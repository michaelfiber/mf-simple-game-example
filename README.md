Simple example using raylib to have an image on screen moved around by arrow keys.

This uses [raylib](https://raylib.com) because it is so simple and straight forward. 

It just draws an image on screen and you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the image around.

There is a build script for Linux, I only develop on Linux so I don't have one handy for Windows but the code itself should compile for Linux or Windows without issue.
